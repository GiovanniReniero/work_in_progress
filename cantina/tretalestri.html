            Talestri, the Queen of the Amazons, possessed a unique blend of
            tenacity and elegance. Similarly, the three sisters Anna, Lisa, and
            Francesca, exude these remarkable qualities. Raised within a wine
            making family their father, Francesco Marcato, and his brothers
            produced exquisite Soave and Durello wines. This family legacy was
            nurtured in Lavagno, a charming town in Verona, located in the
            Eastern region of Valpolicella.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Talestri project, however, emerged as a fresh beginning for the
            sisters on their estate situated 160 meters above sea level. What
            sets their vineyards apart is the unique composition of the soil. It
            is primarily composed of sedimentary limestone, which is
            characteristic of the Valpolicella region, interspersed with
            occasional basalt outcrops, a common occurrence in the eastern part
            of the Verona province. Facing south, their vineyards bask in the
            warm embrace of the sun throughout the day. Yet, they are also
            blessed by a gentle constant breeze, offering respite and coolness.
            As night falls, the vineyards are refreshed by the invigorating
            mountain winds, ensuring the optimal conditions for the grapes to
            thrive and develop their flavors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since 2020, the wines produced by the sisters have achieved the
            prestigious SQNPI certification, which stands for the National
            Quality System for Integrated Production. This certification is a
            testament to their unwavering dedication to sustainability. Their
            commitment is evident through their continuous efforts to minimize
            the use of chemical substances and reduce energy consumption. In
            their vineyards, the slopes have been adorned with a variety of
            plants that emit captivating essences and fragrances, attracting
            bees and promoting biodiversity. Additionally, they have implemented
            the practice of sowing green manure crops. This enriches the soil
            with organic matter and encourages the growth of fibrous roots,
            further enhancing the health of the vineyard ecosystem. To minimize
            their environmental impact, Anna, Lisa, and Francesca rely on energy
            from renewable sources. By harnessing renewable energy, they
            contribute to a greener future while ensuring their operations align
            with sustainable practices. Furthermore, they employ solely organic
            pest control methods, prioritizing natural solutions that preserve
            the ecosystem's balance and protect the health of their vineyards.
            Through their SQNPI certification and their conscious choices, the
            three sisters demonstrate their commitment to producing wines that
            harmonize with nature, embodying the true essence of sustainable
            winemaking.

            A unique and definitely different kind of sparkling wine you
            wouldnâ€™t expect. The grapes are well balanced and the result is an
            elegant and we could say assertive and cosy kinda wine that you
            would expect from a good Valpolicella red wine. Dense texture,
            absolute linearity and a persistent tang, enhanced by an extremely
            fine and creamy perlage. Memorable character and structure, a
            pleasure to try.
          </p>

            Its colour is light yellow, clear and bright with intriguing golden
            highlights
          </p>
          <p>
            Apricot and lychees aromas fading into a citrus note; harmonious
            hints of thyme, green pepper and chamomile. It finishes with a
            slight hint of acacia flowers and biscuit aromas.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's silky, with a decisive, full-flavoured structure, citrusy with
            an extremely fine perlage which releases intriguing notes of
            blackcurrants. The almond fragrance finishes with delicate essences
            of acacia flowers.

            Bubbly Bandits think it goes really well with appetizers and raw
            fish, or with dishes of veg and eggs and white meat.
