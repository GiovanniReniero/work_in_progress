          <p>
            Talestri was the Queen of the Amazons and these three sisters, Anna,
            Lisa and Francesca have definitely got the tenacity and elegance of
            three sovereigns. They were born and bred in the winery where their
            father Francesco Marcato produced Soave and Durello wine with his
            brothers, in Lavagno in Verona in the Veneto region, East
            Valpolicella.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Talestri project, though, was created for a fresh start in their
            estate located at 160 metres above sea level, stretching out to
            embrace the San Briccio hill, an ancient underwater volcano. The
            special quality of their vineyards is the make-up of the land
            consisting of sedimentary limestones, typical of the Valpolicella
            area, with occasional basalt outcrops, a common feature of the
            eastern part of the province of Verona. The vineyards face south and
            make the most of the sun-drenched warmth of the day, cooled by a
            constant breeze and refreshed at night by mountain winds.
          </p>
          <p>
            From 2020, their wines obtained the SQNPI certification (- National
            Quality System for Integrated Production) certifying the company's
            pledge to sustainability. With relentless commitment, they have
            focused on reducing chemical substances and energy consumption. The
            slopes have been covered in essences and fragrances that attract
            bees, and they have sown green manure crops to enrich the soil with
            organic substances and fibrous roots. They also use energy from
            renewable sources and only organic pest control methods

            A unique and definitely different kind of sparkling wine you
            wouldnâ€™t expect. The grapes are well balanced and the result is an
            elegant and we could say assertive and cosy kinda wine that you
            would expect from a good Valpolicella red wine. to it: surprising
            freshness, dense texture, absolute linearity and a persistent tang,
            enhanced by an extremely fine and creamy perlage. Memorable
            character and structure, a pleasure to try.
          </p>
          <p>
            Its colour is light yellow, clear and bright with intriguing golden
            highlights
          </p>
          <p>
            Apricot and lychees aromas fading into a citrus note; harmonious
            hints of thyme, green pepper and chamomile. It finishes with a
            slight hint of acacia flowers and biscuit aromas.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's silky, with a decisive, full-flavoured structure, citrusy with
            an extremely fine perlage which releases intriguing notes of
            blackcurrants. The almond fragrance finishes with delicate essences
            of acacia flowers.
          </p>
          <p>
            We think it goes really well with appetizers and raw fish, or with
            dishes of veg and eggs and white meat.
