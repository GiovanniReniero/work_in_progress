          <p>
            Nestled in the easternmost section of the beautiful, rolling Lessini
            hills, near a stone's throw away from Verona, lies the boutique
            Fongaro Winery. This remarkable family run estate stands as a
            staunch advocate for organic farming, and has dedicated its efforts
            to the production of exceptional Traditional Method Durello
            sparkling wine.
          </p>
          <p>
            Established by the visionary Guerrino Fongaro in 1975, Fongaro Wines
            established themselves in renouned Roncà village area. This idyllic
            location rests upon the Tertiary volcanic outcrops of the Lessini
            region, not far from the renowned townlet of Bolca. Bolca itself has
            gained fame for its remarkable wealth of well-preserved Eocene
            fossils, adding an aura of intrigue to the winery's surroundings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Guerrino placed his bets on the indigenous Lessinia grape variety,
            Durella. This particular vine, of ancient origin, witnessed
            something of a renaissance in Italy in the late 1960’s when the
            wines that come from its fruit started to gather noticeable traction
            nationally and abroad as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            The unique properties of the Durella grape are pertinent to the rich
            soil and the cool mountainous environment it thrives in. The juice
            from its grapes is vinified through maceration with skins and
            produces “hard wine for hard people”, as the locals like to boast.
            Often, it’s watered down or used for blending to increase the
            acidity of other wines.
          </p>
          <p>
            Durella grapes are particularly well suited to the production of
            exceptional sparkling wines and Fongaro produces some of the better
            stuff! Fongaro believes in the Traditional method, exclusively and
            Bubbly Bandits finds that Fongaro wines highlight the distinct
            quality of the Durella grape in a pleasant and very refined manner.
          </p>
          <p>
            Around 1985, Fongaro embraced organic farming and turned his winery
            into the first organic winery in the Veneto region, which is of
            course one of the biggest wine producing regions of Italy and the
            world. To this day Fongaro produces certified organic wines.

            FONGARO-Viola Brut: Golden yellow, intense and intriguing, with fine
            bubbles that rise up the glass relentlessly! Notes of bread crust,
            peanut butter and hazelnut dominate, but as minutes pass, the
            bouquet is enriched, floral notes accompanied by sensations of
            exotic fruit and yellow grapefruit and apple come through. Pleasant
            nuances of vanilla and sweet tobacco further embellish the aromatic
            framework of this wine.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dry, taut yet soft and velvety on the palate. The elegant freshness
            gives way to toasted notes bursting with exotic fruit that give a
            harmonious and intense flavour. The finish is elegant and
            well-balanced
          </p>
          <p>
            Really good with aged cheese, fab with pasta or dumplings or even
            chicken based dishes. We enjoy it with Indian and Chinese food.

            This pas dosè is elegant and complex with notes of white flowers,

          <p>
            Goes with everything in BubblyBandit's view, but it's at its best
            with aged cheeses or a mild Indian curry, pasta (of course) or a not
            too spicy Mexican taco dish.
